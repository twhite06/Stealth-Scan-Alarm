# Stealth-Scan-Alarm
# Timothy White II
# 3 - 15 - 2021

- My alarm is able to succesfully detect:
      - Someone scanning for Server Message Block (SMB) protocol
      - Nikto scan
      - Usernames and passwords sent in-the-clear via HTTP Basic Authentication, FTP, and IMAP
      - FIN scan 
      - XMAS scan 
      - NULL scan

- I searched heavily online for information that I wasn't clear on via google, and I collaborated with:
      - Ming Chow (Professor)
      - Kai (Student)
      - Mike Hu (Student)
      - Alfred (Mentor)
